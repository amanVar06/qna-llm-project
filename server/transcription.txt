I'm going to show you how to use OpenAI's Whisperer API to transcribe audio files into text from Node.js, walk through the steps of setting up our environment, obtaining an API key, and finally writing some code to transcribe our audio file. Let's get started. First, let's talk about how to setup the environment. In your terminal, you'll want to run the following commands. npm init-y This will initialize a new npm project. Next, we're going to type npm i.env axeos form-date This will install the required packages that we're going to use. Finally we're going to type touch index.js and.env This will create your index file and a new.env file.) Then you will need to navigate to the OpenAI website, create an account and your generate an API key. Once you have the key, you will want to add it to your.env file like so openai underscore api underscore key equals then paste in your key there. Now let's take a look at the code. First we're going to be imported into the required packages.env axios fs path and form our API key to be a constant called openAIAPIKey using the process.env. Next we're defining a constant called file path. That points to the audio file we want to transcribe. Next we have another constant called model. This specifies which model we want to use for the transcription. After that we create a new form data object and append the model and audio file to it. Then we use Axios to send a POS request to the OpenAI API's transcription endpoint passing the form data object as the data payload. We also want to include our API key in the headers specify the content as multi-part Form data. If the request is successful, you may want to use the left or low
